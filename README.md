# dvSwitches
This repository has a list of scripts that I have created to make dvSwitch operations easier / automated.

## Get-dvSwitchBackup.ps1 
This script allows you to take a backup of your dvSwitches and port groups, this allows for vCenter failures etc. 
Should vCenter fail you would be able to restore them into the new vCenter server.

## Get-MultidvSwitchBackup.ps1 
This script allows you to take a backup of multiple vCenter Server dvSwitches and port groups. 
Should vCenter fail you would be able to restore them into the new vCenter server.
